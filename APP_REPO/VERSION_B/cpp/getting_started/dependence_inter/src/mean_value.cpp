    This example intends to demonstrate HLS Dependence Pragma.
    Using "HLS DEPENDECE" pragma user can provide additional dependency 
    details to compiler which allows compiler to implement unrolling/pipelining 
    in optimized manner.
    
                "Vector Mean Value Calculation"
    
    Arguments:
        in   (input)  --> Input Vector
        out  (output) --> Output Mean Vector
        size (input)  --> Size of Vector in Integer

*******************************************************************************/

#include <hls_stream.h>
#include <ap_int.h>
#include "mean_value.h"

#define MAX_SIZE 1024

void mean_value_accel(int *in, int *out, int size)
{
    // Local Buffer is declared double to store both input and output data
    int local_buffer[2 * MAX_SIZE];

    // Burst read of input data from DDR memory
    input_read:for (int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++){
    #pragma HLS PIPELINE
    #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=256 max=256

    #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=254 max=254
    #pragma HLS DEPENDENCE variable=local_buffer inter false
    // HLS Dependence pragma provides extra dependency information to compiler.
    // For example here local_buffer has false inter dependency. Which means
    // each iteration of loop is independent for local_buffer access.
    // It allows compiler to ignore dependency of local_buffer and generate
    // a pipeline with lower II count. 

    // If user fails to provide this pragma, by default compiler assumes
    // dependency exists on local_buffer for entire iteration. 
    
    // As a result, compiler schedules unoptimized design with larger II factor
    // which in turn leads to drop in performance.
        local_buffer[i + MAX_SIZE] = (local_buffer[i-1] + local_buffer[i] + 
                                     local_buffer[i+1])/3;

    // Calculating average for Boundary Case values
    local_buffer[MAX_SIZE]  = (local_buffer[0] + local_buffer[1]) / 2 ;
    local_buffer[MAX_SIZE + size-1] = (local_buffer[size-1] +
